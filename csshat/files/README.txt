Welcome CSS Hat, the best and fastest way to move layer styles to CSS!

Installation:
	1. Copy "csshat" folder into photoshop Plug-ins/Panels folder.
		- On Mac it is usually in /Applications/Adobe Photoshop (version)/Plug-ins/Panels
		- On Windows it should be in C:/Program Files/Adobe/Adobe Photoshop (version)/Plug-ins/Panels
	2. You will find CSS Hat Panel in Photoshop under Window > Extensions > CSS Hat
	3. Enjoy!
	4. Please report bugs to support@csshat.com

CSS Hat can give you CSS for:
	* layer color and gradient fill
	* layer effects: 
		- drop shadow
		- inner shadow
		- inner glow
		- outer glow
		- gradient overlay - normal and reflected, linear and radial gradient
		- solid color overlay
		- stroke
	* font properties:
		- color
		- text-shadow
		- font-family
		- font-size
		- font-weight
		- font-style
		- text-decoration
	* opacity and layer fill
	* border-radius - either autodetected from shape (if you use Photoshop's round rectangle tool), or from layer name (just add for example '2px' anywhere in the layer name)
	* gradients can have linear, reflected or radial types so far
	* vendor prefixes for current browsers, including SVG of gradients for IE9+

CSS Hat outputs code for:
	* CSS
	* LESS with LESS Hat (http://lesshat.com) library
	* SASS/SCSS with Compass (http://compass-style.org/) library
	* Stylus with nib (https://github.com/visionmedia/nib) library

Known bugs:
	* blending modes are ignored so far (as there is no way to express them in CSS), warning is shown in this case
	* colors are a bit off if there is a color profile

In future there will be:
	* more features
	* less bugs :)
